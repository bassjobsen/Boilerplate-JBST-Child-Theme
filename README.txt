/*
==========================================================
ATTENTION!! THIS CHILD THEME IS TO SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE OF
HOW YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE NOT ONLY THE LOOK, BUT THE FUNCTION-
ALITY OF THE SKEMATIK THEME FROM A CHILD THEME.

/*
==========================================================
HERE IS HOW YOU SHOULD GO ABOUT USING THIS THEME YOURSELF.
==========================================================
*/

1) First, rename the theme folder to whatever you want to
call your child theme (no spaces)

2) Open 'style.css' and change the theme info (name, author, description, etc)


/*
==========================================================
FUNCTIONS
==========================================================
*/

You should have a file named 'functions.php' in the theme folder. This file can be used to contain all of your custom functionality.To give you an idea of what you can do, we've included a few sample functions in 'sample-functions.php'. You can copy and paste any of them into your functions file and edit them to your liking. Use them as a guide for writing your own custom actions and filters.


/*
==========================================================
PAGE TEMPLATES
==========================================================
*/

Skematik has it's own templating engine which operates from the index.php file in the parent theme. However, you can make your own custom page templates that override the templating engine and can be selected from the 'Page Attributes' section of your page edit screen. We've included the 'sample-template.php' file as a guide. You can duplicate it, rename it and make as many page templates as you want.
